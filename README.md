# Yamadalyzer

Yamadalyzer is a Java application that can be used to generate the longest path for 5x5 mazes. The user interface is intended to by enabling the user to toggle walls and cells in a map by clicking, then pressing solve to be shown the longest path which traverses over each cell. Maps can be saved and loaded for later use. The future goal with this application is to solve the levels present in the game [Dandy Dungeon: The Legend of Brave Yamada](https://www.dandydungeon.com/) efficiently and with an easy to use interface.

## Rules

Levels in Dandy Dungeon are 5x5. Each level has at least one entrance and one or multiple exits. To perfectly solve a level you have to walk through each cell once, otherwise you will take damage for each cell not traversed. You cannot walk through the same cell twice nor can you walk through walls. You cannot move diagonally.
